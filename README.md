# Teradata-DDL-Extraction
This repository contains script designed for extracting Data Definition Language (DDL) statements for various objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, user-defined functions (UDFs), and macros. These DDL statements are stored in a migration history table. The data within this migration history table can subsequently be utilized to convert Teradata DDLs into Databricks DDLs for the migration process.
